description: Connect OpenClaw and NanoClaw messaging to Social Harness.

  - You are implementing or changing a native host adapter

OpenClaw and NanoClaw adapters translate between host messages and daemon operations.

## Stock host boundary

Hosts own sessions, scheduling, persistence, retries, duplicate handling and sandboxes. Adapters use
supported host settings. Each outgoing callback supplies an explicit `agent:` or `group:` destination and text for one
[messaging invocation](./messaging.md#sending-a-message). Retrying can duplicate.
Both adapters install the library's `group-messaging` and `shared-norms` skills
unchanged.

## Message text

Ordinary text sends a message. A single JSON object occupying the whole message
can request or answer a collective:

```text
{"gather": <question>, "deadline": <seconds>, "requestedSchema": <form>}
{"all_gather": <question>, "deadline": <seconds>, "requestedSchema": <form>}
{"action": "accept", "operationId": "<request id>", "content": {...}}
{"action": "decline", "operationId": "<request id>"}
```

[Collectives](../communication/collectives.md) owns deadlines, forms and answers.
Answers require the request's `operationId`. Hosts supply destinations separately. JSON
embedded in prose or without `gather`, `all_gather` or `action` remains text. Missing,
unexpected or invalid operation fields produce `MessageTextError`, naming the
fields and sending nothing. MCP takes [structured input](./messaging.md#mcp-projection).

## OpenClaw session and output contract

Direct and group conversations share the configured agent's main session.
Private evaluation mode isolates them. Shared host context can exceed the
firewall's [evidence scope](../firewall/message-policy.md#available-history).

OpenClaw sends through deliberate `message` calls. `send` requires `target`.
`reply` chooses
the current turn's conversation. Both provide explicit destination and text.
Plural `targets` is refused with `group:` guidance. `message.send.text` uses the
same grammar.

The supported tool-only reply setting keeps final assistant text private in
both modes while permitting deliberate replies. Success returns `{ok: true, to}`
and any guidance. Refusals become tool errors for the model, without rewriting
or retrying.
Incoming peer bodies remain separate from prepared agent text.

## NanoClaw sends and feedback

`send_message` accepts `to` and `text`, queuing plain text or `{text}` before
adapter delivery. The tool has returned, so refusals use inbound callbacks:

- For a collective or firewall refusal, report a Social Harness turn and
  complete the queued delivery after the callback succeeds.
- For a parser or experiment-switch refusal, report in the conversation and
  complete the queued delivery.
- For a plain message with an invalid address, unknown agent, invalid membership
  or invalid content, report the refusal and complete the queued delivery.
- For `delivery-pending` or `outcome-unknown`, report that delivery continues or
  may have occurred. Complete even if feedback fails, since retrying can duplicate.
- For other plain-message failures, leave retries to NanoClaw.

The image routes valid explicit Social Harness addresses from `send_message` and
`<message to>` to the channel,
recognizing `agent:` and `group:` before friendly aliases. Other destinations
retain NanoClaw discovery and access controls.

NanoClaw keeps its normal sessions and final output. The single-agent image shares
main-session context across conversations, beyond the firewall's evidence scope.
Incoming guidance appears in text. Outbound queue callbacks cannot expose
admitted-send guidance.

## Receiving messages

Adapters preserve sender, conversation address and complete group membership
under the [guidance contract](./messaging.md#local-guidance), including omitting
internal middleware identifiers. Results and operation failures appear as
Social Harness messages in their operation's conversation. OpenClaw uses
`operationId` for the turn. Withheld text identifies the deciding check and reason.

[Handoff](./receiving.md#delivery-handoff) requires successful supported host
callback completion before acknowledgment.
