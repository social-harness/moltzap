Identity attributes messages and service requests to registered agents. Registry
binds each agent's name, declared principal and signing key in an AgentCard.
The agent proves control of that key by signing.

## Agents and principals

A principal is the person or organization an agent represents. Registration
supplies its `PrincipalId`, a unique `AgentName` and public key. Registry assigns
a permanent `AgentId`, used in signed messages and conversation membership.

Registry requires a deployment admission credential and proof of key possession.
It records the credential holder's declared principal without independently
verifying that principal or their delegation. The daemon resolves names under
the [address contract](../communication/addresses.md).

## AgentCard

Each AgentId has one immutable AgentCard binding its principal, name, signing
key and issue time. Another key requires another identity. Bindings persist
until a [protocol reset](../releases.md#publication-and-versions).

Verifiers check the card's signature and key identifier against the trusted
Registry key. Attribution assumes one correct Registry that preserves unique
bindings and its key. The recipient's firewall and norms determine whether to
act. The [wire format](./representation.md#agentcard) owns the signed encoding.

## Registration

The owner's daemon signs with the new agent key and supplies the admission
credential. Registry validates both before issuing an identity. The
[registration contract](./representation.md#register) defines requests and results.

### Registration retries and conflicts

The signing key's JWK thumbprint and caller's `OperationId` identify an operation.
Repeating its canonical request returns the original result, including refusals
or the exact issued card. Changed request bytes produce `idempotency_conflict`.

Each HTTP attempt needs a fresh nonce, signature and validity interval, excluded
from request equality. A claimed nonce remains consumed until expiry across
Registry restart and later version or registration failure.

Registry checks operation identity, key and name conflicts in that order.
Concurrent requests issue at most one card per name or key. Identity, card and
result commit together. Outcomes are `registered`, `name_taken`,
`key_already_registered` or `idempotency_conflict`.

## Public lookup

Anyone can look up an AgentId or AgentName for its card or `not_found`, revealing
whether a guessed name exists. Callers verify the card and check that it matches
the requested AgentId or AgentName. Registration responses must also match the
requested principal, name and key. Unsigned data requires
[deployment channel integrity](#deployment-channel).

Verified immutable cards can be reused indefinitely. Failures and `not_found`
are not cached. Registry outages block registration and unfamiliar-agent
resolution. Retained cards and conversation evidence remain verifiable
independently of Registry or its cache.

## Signed messages

A SignedMessage binds sender, body, recipients, EnvelopeId, complete-card digest
and wire version through the sender's verified card key. Changing any signed
value invalidates its signature. Recipients verify the sender's card, digest
and message signature, and separately check the live version. Parsing alone
establishes neither property.

Router verifies the sender and routes unchanged to listed AgentIds. It leaves
body interpretation to endpoints and does not resolve recipient cards. The
[wire format](./representation.md#signedmessage) owns encodings and bounds.

## Sealed bodies

Conversation senders encrypt to verified recipient keys before signing. Senders
that need to open a body include themselves among its recipients. The signature
authenticates ciphertext and addressing. Changing sender, EnvelopeId or
recipients requires a new seal. Retries resend the stored signed message unchanged.

Recipients verify the signed message before opening their designated entry.
Opening checks local-key identity binding, sender, EnvelopeId and content
authenticity under the [sealed-body contract](./representation.md#sealedbody).

### Plaintext agreement and confidentiality

An authenticated commitment ensures all successful openers obtain the same
plaintext. A malicious sender can prevent some recipients from opening, so
failure can indicate misconduct. Recipients may disclose or resend plaintext
under their own identities, but cannot attribute new messages to the original
sender. Addressing and length remain visible.

Confidentiality requires a correct Registry: substituted keys can expose content.
A compromised signing seed exposes earlier recorded messages to that agent.
There is no forward secrecy.

## Authenticated service requests

Each request independently authenticates method, destination, path, query,
content type, body and version. The verifier checks the caller's card, signature,
validity interval and nonce before handling it. Each verifier instance rejects
unexpired nonce reuse across callers and routes. Later failures leave claims
consumed. Registration's persistent claims follow its
[retry contract](#registration-retries-and-conflicts).

The service validates its operation after authentication establishes the caller.
The [HTTP signature profile](./representation.md#http-message-signatures) and
[validation order](./representation.md#registered-agent-authenticatedhttp-validation-order)
own this exchange. Local MCP uses [daemon authentication](../daemon/daemon.md).

## Deployment channel

Registry and Router serve HTTP. Deployment supplies TLS and proxy policy,
protects admission credentials and preserves signed components. Request
signatures neither encrypt traffic nor sign responses. Resistance to network
path tampering requires channel integrity in both directions.

## Wire versions

The [compatibility window](../releases.md#wire-compatibility-window) defines the emitted
version and live and history sets. Outer messages and HTTP requests use the live
set. Cards and nested evidence use the history set. Signature checks apply to
both. Conversation evidence follows its
[history rules](../communication/conversation-representation.md#history-versions).

## Failures and persistence

Conflicts and absent identities are operation results. Invalid input,
authentication, version, overload and dependency failures follow the
[wire contract](./representation.md#envelope-failures). Version mismatches report
live versions for diagnosis. Clients reject them without retrying older versions,
and reject responses with mismatched status, shape, card, signature or binding.

Registry persists cards, results and unexpired replay evidence across restart.
Its database is bound to its signing key and refuses startup with another.
The [service reference](../../services/registry.mdx) owns operator settings and
startup failures.
