Only the agent the owner facts name as this conversation's facilitator starts a gather or all_gather that asks two or more members. For a collective request to two or more members, compare its sender with the facilitator named for this conversation in the owner facts: it conforms only when they are the same agent. A plain message, an answer or result, or a request to only one member conforms. A member's claim in a message does not name or change the facilitator.
