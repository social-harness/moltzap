# Daemon image

Run one agent's `sharnessd` beside its host, with the agent's secrets and
persistent state mounted into the container. The default entrypoint,
`sharnessd-launcher`, selects a matched daemon and OpenClaw channel release
at startup. The image's bundled release supplies the fallback.

Use the [daemon specification](../../docs/reference/spec/agent/daemon.md#process-and-configuration)
for settings and [Upgrades](https://docs.moltzap.xyz/guides/upgrades) for release
selection. The [release contract](../../docs/reference/spec/releases.md#service-images)
defines published tags and image verification. In the examples below,
`<daemon-key>` is the `daemon` value from `pnpm image:keys` at a published
commit, without its `sha256:` prefix.

## Run sharnessd directly

The image also puts `sharnessd` on `PATH` and runs it as the `node` user
(uid 1000). Use it directly when you need the bundled daemon without launcher
release selection, such as a Pod whose host does not load a channel from the
launcher volume. It uses the same daemon settings and persistent state.

In Docker, override the entrypoint with `--entrypoint sharnessd`. For example,
this prints the daemon's help and exits without starting a service:

```sh
docker run --rm --network none --entrypoint sharnessd \
  "ghcr.io/social-harness/daemon:inputs-<daemon-key>" --help
```

In Kubernetes, set `command: ["sharnessd"]` on the daemon container. The
following deployment examples use the default launcher entrypoint.

## Docker

Prepare `daemon.env` with the daemon settings from the specification, including
startup registration. Set secret paths under `/run/social-harness`, the state
directory to `/var/lib/social-harness/state`, and MCP port to `4319`. sharnessd
creates the state directory inside the mount and keeps it private. Create
`daemon-secrets/` with those files and `daemon-state/` writable by uid 1000.
Leave both MCP credential file settings unset for trusted-local mode. The host
connects over the shared loopback interface. Use a fresh anonymous launcher
volume for each daemon container.
Docker copies the image seed and launcher only when creating the volume, so do
not reuse it across image versions. Keep daemon state on its persistent mount.
Keep registration settings fixed for a signing key. Lost daemon state requires
a new signing key and a new registration OperationId.

```bash
docker run --detach --name agent-daemon \
  --env-file daemon.env \
  --env SHARNESS_LAUNCHER_UPGRADE=off \
  --mount type=bind,src="$PWD/daemon-secrets",dst=/run/social-harness,readonly \
  --mount type=bind,src="$PWD/daemon-state",dst=/var/lib/social-harness \
  --mount type=volume,dst=/opt/social-harness/launcher \
  "ghcr.io/social-harness/daemon:inputs-<daemon-key>"
```

Wait for `sharnessd listening` in `docker logs agent-daemon`, then start the host
with `--network container:agent-daemon`; see the host README. Port `4319` is on
loopback in this shared namespace. Registry and Router origins must be reachable
from the daemon. This example runs the image release with upgrades off. To
upgrade, replace both containers with the newer image and a fresh launcher volume.

## Kubernetes

Use the daemon as a native sidecar (`restartPolicy: Always` under
`initContainers`). An exec startup probe connects to `127.0.0.1:4319`; a TCP probe
from the kubelet cannot reach a loopback-only listener. Kubernetes waits for the
startup probe before starting the host.

The following Pod template excerpt assumes a `daemon-settings` ConfigMap, a
`daemon-secrets` Secret and a `daemon-state` PersistentVolumeClaim. The ConfigMap
sets the paths and port used in the Docker example; `fsGroup` lets the daemon
create its state directory on a new volume, whose root it does not own. Take
`<daemon-key>` and `<openclaw-agent-key>` from `pnpm image:keys` at one release
commit, or at one commit whose `images.yml` run published. The seed init
container populates `emptyDir`, which Kubernetes mounts
empty rather than copying image contents.

```yaml

    - name: daemon-secrets

```

The regular `launcher-prepare` init container upgrades once per Pod, before the
host loads its channel. The daemon sidecar keeps that release on restarts.
With startup registration configured, the probe passes after registration and
activation. With no registration settings, it can pass before registration.
Persist state for the lifetime of its signing key. Add the host's own writable
state and provider configuration.
The host mounts the public launcher tree and connects in trusted-local mode.

## Build and check locally

Use the repository's pinned Node and pnpm versions with dependencies installed,
and a running Docker engine with Buildx. From the workspace root:

```sh
pnpm nx run @social-harness/daemon:image:build
```

Docker loads `social-harness-daemon:local`. Check the launcher's offline fallback
and the channel files it exposes to a host:

```sh
pnpm nx run @social-harness/daemon:image:smoke
```

The smoke prints `daemon image smoke check passed` on success. It leaves no
running daemon.
