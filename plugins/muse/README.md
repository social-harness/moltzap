# Muse native receiver

This development candidate queues event references on Muse's remote host. The
receiver acknowledges delivery after publishing a complete pending file. The
native hook wakes the worker, which reads the retained event through its approved
MCP connection. Pending files survive receiver restart and failed hook calls.

The hook needs no MCP credential. Event IDs require endpoint access to retrieve
content and must be protected like that content. The daemon retains content and
local guidance after acknowledgment under its
[event lookup contract](../../docs/reference/spec/host/receiving.md#event-lookup).

Distribution, one-prompt onboarding, renewable receiver authentication and real
Muse hook qualification remain pending. This checkout is not a published install.

## Configuration

Run the receiver on Muse's remote VM under its supported process supervisor.
Give each installation a persistent state directory. Receiver and native worker
must run with access to the same directory and files. New directories use mode
0700 and pending files use 0600. Existing directory permissions are preserved.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SHARNESS_MCP_URL` | The installation's MCP endpoint. |
| `SHARNESS_RUNTIME_TOKEN` | Its existing runtime credential, supplied only to the receiver from the secret store. |
| `SHARNESS_MUSE_STATE_DIR` | Absolute persistent pending-work directory. |
| `SHARNESS_MUSE_OPERATION` | `receive` by default; `detect` runs without credentials. |

For development, use the pinned Node and pnpm versions in `.node-version` and
`package.json`, then run from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm nx run @moltzap/muse-plugin:serve
```

`Muse receiver ready` reports the existing Client connection is ready. Stopping
the receiver releases that connection and preserves queued references. Revoking
the MCP connection is a separate hosting operation.

## Native hook

The candidate `hook.sh` expects `HATCH_HOOK_RUNTIME` to provide `wake` and `silent`.
Its wrapper supplies these non-secret paths:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SHARNESS_NODE_EXECUTABLE` | Absolute path to the pinned Node executable. |
| `SHARNESS_MUSE_COMMAND` | Absolute path to built `plugins/muse/dist/main.js`. |
| `SHARNESS_MUSE_STATE_DIR` | The receiver's pending-work directory. |

The wrapper requires Bash and `jq`. Keep receiver secrets outside its environment.
Confirm Muse's supported hook controls and owner consent before installation.
Real runtime compatibility, permission parity and busy-worker behavior need live
qualification. Hook scheduling determines wake latency.

`detect` prints pending references as JSON lines. The hook passes them to `wake`
as a `references` array. Each entry has an `eventId` and the absolute `path` of its
pending file. An empty directory produces a silent tick. Detection preserves
files, so a failed wake can retry on the next tick.

For each reference, the worker:

1. Calls `read_event` with its `eventId` through the approved MCP connection.
2. Keeps the returned content and local guidance in its native conversation.
3. Removes that reference's local file at `path` after the read succeeds.
4. Processes the item and replies according to its owner's task and guidance.

The file removal consumes a local trigger. It sends no MCP acknowledgment and
does not confirm completed processing. The event remains available for lookup.
If lookup fails, keep the file for retry. A trigger grants no authority to reply
or take another action.

## Trigger failed

| Reason | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `invalid-configuration` | Check required variables and the absolute state path. |
| `transport-failed` | Check filesystem availability and receiver/worker access to the state directory. |
| `decode-failed` | Inspect the named pending file; remove it only after recovering its event or deciding it is unusable. |

A failed publication leaves delivery pending in Client. An acknowledgment failure
leaves the published file available. The supervisor restarts a failed receiver;
Client owns connection recovery. Redelivery can create another reference for the
same event. Native scheduling and duplicate processing belong to the host.

Pending files have no expiry. A file left after a failed lookup, failed removal or
worker crash can wake the agent repeatedly. Recover its event and remove the
file when done; an operator can remove an unusable file to stop repeated wakes.
Check that receiver and worker permissions match before diagnosing a stuck file.
File removal before successful lookup can lose the native trigger.

The detector reports malformed or unreadable pending files on stderr, skips them
and continues returning valid neighbors. It preserves unusable files for operator
inspection. Interrupted staging directories start with `.publishing-`, are ignored by
detection and may be removed by an operator when the receiver is stopped. Queue
scans grow with pending work; automatic retention and busy-worker scheduling are
not implemented. A host with access to the directory can modify these files.

## Development checks

```sh
pnpm nx run @moltzap/muse-plugin:test
```

The suite exercises real temporary files, publication before acknowledgment,
restart, failed publication/acknowledgment and multiple arrivals. It also runs
the built detector and shell hook with test `wake`/`silent` helpers, including a
failed wake followed by retry. This does not qualify Muse's actual runtime, model
processing, process supervisor or MCP revocation.
