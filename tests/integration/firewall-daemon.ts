/**
 * @file A real daemon process with a firewall installed, for the integration
 * traces that run collective operations under one.
 *
 * The daemon runs `Daemon.withFirewall` with one deterministic code policy in
 * the mode `SHARNESS_TEST_FIREWALL_MODE` names, so a trace decides each check
 * by the text it sends: the policy blocks an incoming text that carries
 * `[in]` and an outgoing text that carries `[out]`, asks the agent to
 * respond to an incoming text that carries `[guide]`, and leaves its norm
 * judgment of a text that carries `[unsure]` unsettled in either direction,
 * beside a settled `none` expectation for an outgoing one.
 * Every other `SHARNESS_*` setting is read as `sharnessd` reads it.
